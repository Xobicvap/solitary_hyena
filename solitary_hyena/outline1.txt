ok so... how do we want to handle variables for a user module? or structures?

and... how would we do d&d combat? (for example)?
ok so.. not only do we need *variables* in a user module... we need variable DEFINITIONS
which i guess is the same thing
no, we need TYPES
and can we please get rid of the ALL CAPS for at least types?
we also need a way in types (or var defs?) to make results without assigning  

definition for type:
  &dretch : { AC= 17, HP: 4?..32, ATTACKS: [1?..4, 1?..4, 2?..8],
    SPECIAL: [
      {darkness: {radius: 5}},
       scare


d&d combat
  list monsters i.e. {"dretch": 8}
  look up monsters in vars
    HOW?
    wow we're going to have to register and instantiate types!



{
  "user_modules": [
    {
      "type": "d&d",
      "
